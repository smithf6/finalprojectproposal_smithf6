<h2>Final Project Proposal</h2>
<h3>Interactive Walk-In Fridge</h3>
<p>
The idea I had for a website was to make a visual layout for a fridge that could be used to keep track of what items were in stock in a restaraunt setting.<br>
The general layout would be a view of the fridge with every shelf visable, and a way to select between them. On each shelf would contain individual items<br>
that can be selected to with an animation to designate whats being viewed. Items would show the number of protions left and alert for 0 left.<br>

Another feature would be a prep list page with a way to enter values for the remaining portions. This would act as a managerial type interface that someone<br>
could use to adjust the visuals of the interactive fridge.

<h4>Relevant Links</h4>
<a href="https://www.cssscript.com/animated-virtual-bookshelf/">Animated Bookshelf</a>
<p>
This is a reference I think might be useful to help create the animations for hovering or clicking on individual items.<br>
In the project this person created when you hover over individual spines of books the spin outward and show more information.

<h4>Challenges</h4>
I havent fully worked out how I will use javascript to store the values entered in the prep list page, and how to use them to adjust the visual fridge.<br>
<br>
Use of the css and javascript animations is fairly new to me so there may be hurdles I run into while making the visualizaiton.
